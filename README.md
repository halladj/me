# Zettelkasten Notes

This repository contains my personal Zettelkasten, a collection of interconnected notes designed to organize ideas, foster creativity, and enhance learning.

## ðŸ“– About

The Zettelkasten method helps link individual notes (or "zettels") to create a web of knowledge. Each note in this repository is self-contained but may link to others to form meaningful connections.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

All notes are stored in the root folder with no subdirectories. The flat structure ensures simplicity and ease of navigation.

File Naming: Each note has a unique identifier (e.g., 20250101223433.md) for easy reference.
Links: Notes are interconnected using Markdown links for seamless exploration.
## ðŸš€ Usage

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/halladj/me.git  
Open the folder in your preferred Markdown editor (e.g., Obsidian, Zettlr).
Explore notes and follow links to discover connections.
## ðŸ›  Recommendations

To make the most of this Zettelkasten:

Use a Markdown editor with backlink support.
Regularly review and expand connections between notes.

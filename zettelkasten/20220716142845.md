# Reading and Note-taking

Well if you want to acquire some knowledge, there is one of two approaches you
are probably going to take, you either gonna watch some visual content or read some kind of
a written content (book, article, etc). i can say that reading is the more effective approach at least that's me but, 
reading can be tedious sometimes especially when you are having a bad day, so one must follow some strategy 
to get the most out of his efforts, one strategy i might suggest is taking notes but, not the kind of notes we are
used to take in classes, instead, i mean using a proven note-taking method like Zettelkasten.

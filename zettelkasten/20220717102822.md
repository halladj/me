## What is Zettelkasten exactly

Zettelkasten is a note-taking method that the german sociologist Niklas Luhmann developed 
, the word zettelkasten itself is german that roughly translates to
"file box" or "slip box", it refers to a system that consists of a storage( physical
like a box or digital ) and notes or zettels stored in the former, these notes are not
an individual texts or even a collection of texts, they form an interconnected network of notes,
each note has the ability to reference other zettels to complete or give more insight on a
single thought or idea, meaning that zettelkasten is a nonlinear system where each zettel
is a single thought and these zettels are connected with each other to form a bigger
picture and this system is considered to be a personal tool so you would write your 
thoughts in the exact manner you think about them.

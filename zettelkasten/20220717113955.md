## How to write a zettel and create your own zettelkasten

A zettel is structred note, it has three components: 
  * Unique Identifier
  * Content
  * References
  
### The Unique Identifier

Each zettel must have a unique identifier, but there is no correct way to construct it, 
but there is couple of identifiers that are a bit more popular: 
  1. alphanumeric identifiers: Niklas Luhmann actually used an alphanumeric identifier in his
  zettelkasten, and it is the recommended method when it comes to paper-based zettelkasten.
  
  2. time-based: a unique string that is constructed from some kind of time-stamp, it is the 
  most used method for digital zettelkastens.

### The Content

In the content section, you will capture the thought(knowledge) are trying to deliver vai that zettel and 
contain in that zettel, there is no rule against having some kind of a quote at the top, but
the content must be written with your words because anything else will be defeating
the purpose of using zettles in the first place.

### The References

References are written at the footer of the zettel, and it reference the source of information
used to write that zettel.

## How to Create Your Own Zettelkasten

Here I will demonstrate how I created my own version of the digital zettelkasten, first of
all we need to find where the zettels are gonna be stored, I preferred using a Github repository
for that purpose, Github has a built-in search engine that will be huge when your zettelkasten
grows naturally, and you also have the ability to put a license for the repository to protect
your content from plagiarism if you want to make it public(please don't store anything of value inside GitHub
private repositories), for the unique identifier a time-based identifier makes the most sense scine 
it is the easiest to contruct and we have GitHub's search engine to find a specific zettel in the
place, finally for writing the content using markdown is the best option to organize your zettel,
markdown is a relatively easy language to learn and has full support in GitHub's built-in editor.

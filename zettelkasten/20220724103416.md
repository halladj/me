## Why should I even care about something like language server protocol

writing code(*programming*) is mostly straightforward, but how it should be written and using which
the suite of tools is one of the most opinionated topics out there, maybe it is a bit over discussed
but personally, I think that's how it should be after all your development environment is one of the
main factors that determine how productive you are. Wouldn't it be great if you could use 
your favorite **Editor** all the time with whatever programming language, that is exactly what LSP(language server protocol)
is used for.

# What is the Language Server Protocol

First of all, what is a communication protocol in the first place, it is a specification(*set of rules*)
that describes how two or more components or entities of some system can exchange information 
, LSP(*Language Server Protocol*) is a protocol created by Microsoft(**the badies**) that formalizes how a text editor or IDE and language servers could 
communicate, where a language server will be the provider of language-specific features like:
  * go to definition
  * auto-completion
  * snippets
  * go to reference
  * code actions
  
 and that will allow the developers to have some kind of standardization as well they don't have to reimplement all the features 
 for each new language they want to support instead, they will rely on the mentioned before language server, whereas the users
 will be able to sustain their development ecosystem while working with whatever programming language they wish.

# Simplicity in UNIX shines over the other systems

Engineers or developers are often bright people, and usually, they are proud of writing
complex, intelligent solutions and would go as far as bragging about them, whereas UNIX philosophy
favors simplicity always over elegant abstractions, which in fact can be seen in a lot of commercial
software that was designed with a ton of checklist features, that usually are not useful to 
the targeted users, causing everyone to use bloated systems with huge running programs that no
one uses or even cares about.

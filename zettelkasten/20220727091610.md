# Whats docker used for

Before docker was a thing, shipping software was a huge miss, ton of defferent technologies 
were involved such:
 1. Virtual Machines
 2. package management systems
 3. config management tools
 4. a pile of interconnected dependencies
meaning each team member of the different teams involved into the developement process would
have to get that huge pile of miss to work, you could image how painfull that would be,
thats where docker comes into plat where docker gives the ability to contain the intire 
software stack and published it(publicly or ptivatly) as an image to the members to use,
by use i mean a simple command line ``` docker run <<image-name>> ```

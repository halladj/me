# What's docker used for

Before docker was a thing, developing, testing and shipping software was a huge miss and it is still a miss afterward,  don't get me wrong
but at the end of this article, you might appreciate how docker made the process more bearable, those are some of the  technologies used to develope software without using docker:
 1. Virtual Machines
 2. package management systems
 3. config management tools
 4. a pile of interconnected dependencies
meaning each team member of the different teams involved in the development process would
have to get that huge pile of miss to work locally, you could imagine how painful that would be,
that's where docker comes into play, where docker gives the ability to contain the entire 
software stack and published it(publicly or privately) as an image for the members to use,
by use i mean a simple command such ``` docker run <<image-name>> ``` to initiate a container out
of that image.

## What's Docker and Its Architecture

Docker's name comes from the fact that in the early day, a docker was a worker who moved goods on and off the ships, they were known to be so cost-efficient, that they were able to fit items and boxes of different shapes onto the ship,
and that's exactly what docker does with software instead of boxes. So docker is an open-source project made of multiple 
components that work together to achieve the end goal of running, distributing, and building software. The previously mentioned components are:

  1. a CLI client program, used to state commands either directly by an end-user or script to the underlying
  operating system, to run a container, build an image, fetch an image ...etc.
  2. background process (the docker daemon), with an HTTP RESTful API, the daemon would communicate with the CLI
  client and also with other web services to send and receive images.
  3. docker registries can be either private or public, the most used public registry is the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/),
  the registry is used to store images or fetch locally.

Therefore images are like the building units that docker moves(instead of goods) around the web to either run as a container or be used as a layer into 
another docker image, containers can be spun from an image and they are a feature of the UNIX like operating systems family,
they serve as an isolated runtime environment, where such isolation can affect nearly every resource a process can consume 
such: as CPU time, memory, disk space, and ports.

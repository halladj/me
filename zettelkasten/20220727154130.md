## Why docker, we have virtual machines

After knowing what docker is, someone might wonder why should I even care to use docker 
when i can just use a virtual machine(vm). Well docker containers can serve the
same purpose of a vm, while being more effiecent, where a vm provides a virtual hardware
to run an intire operating system on-top the host's, whereas containers are simply a runtime 
enviroment that whould use the host's kernal to communicate with the underlying hardware. but it 
does not end there docker have some more benefits like:

  * **packaging software** is one of the main features I started using docker for, so when I was in my second 
  year of my computer science degree, we had to install Oracle DB on our machines for some class, and some
  of my friends had MacBooks, so they had to choose whether to give up disk space(around 45GB) and use a virtual machine, or
  simply use docker to run it as a container, and you can tell what I helped them achieve.
  * **continous delivry** is a pipeline that enables software to be rebuild and re-deployed whenever there a new a change 
  is develivered to prosuction with little to no down-time.
  * **modeling networds** ,we can spin dozends or even hondreds of contaibers to mimics a respectable newtwork with real
  interactive machines, it gives a greate tool to test real world senarios without breaking the bank.
  * **documenting software dependencies** is a must when working with docker because you must list all the dependencies in the
  DockerFile beforehand, so even if docker wasn't used in all the phases a comprehensive list of dependencies is still there to be used.

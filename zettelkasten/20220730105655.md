* **Zero value** every decalared variable in go is assigned a zero variable.
* **Literals** means untyped variable could refere to numbers, stringd and chars.
  1. Numbers defualt is base 10 but coutld just (*0x[HEX_NUMBER]*, *0b[Binary]*), and you could add 
  2. Rune litteral is char and use (') instead of ("), can use char (*'a'*) or UNICODE (*'/x61'*).
  3. Strings, this is a valid string (*"hamza"*) and this is for escaping (*`hanza`*).
* **Boolean**  *```var flag bool```*  or  *```var hamza=true```*.
* **Intergers** int8[byte], int16, int32, int64, uint8 ......;
*  **Floating point type** float32 and  float64  are IEEE spec sooo yeah.
*  **Compex types** just look them up when u need them ffs.

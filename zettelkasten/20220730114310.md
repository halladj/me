# Composite Types
* **Arrays** are rarelly used becouse of limitations, the len of them is part of its type so only arrays
of the same len can work togeather and u cant declare an array with a var becouse types must be resolved at
compile time and not run time. Declaration styles:
    1. ``` var x [3]int ```
    2. ``` var y = [3]int{1,2,3} ```
    3. ``` var z = [12]int{1, 5:4, 6, 10:100 ,0} ```

* **Slices** are arrays with not predefined size. Declaration: ``` var x= []int ``` or ``` var x= []int{1,2,3} ```.
 and it has some functions like: 
    1. *len*() 
    2. *append*()
    3. *cap*() returns the capacity of a slice.
    4. *make*() is another way to declare a slice ``` var x= make([]int, LENGTH, [CAPACITY]) ``` is just like ``` var x= []int{0,0,0} ```.

* **Map** is a map. ``` var nilMap map[String]int ``` or ``` var mamap map[String] []String{ "hamza": []string{""h", "o","u", "d", "a" } ```.
  use the comma ok idiom ``` v,ok := m["hamza"] ``` to access values.

* **Struct** use 
 ``` 
 type hamaz struct {
         name string
         age int 
 }
 ```

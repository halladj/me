# Overview of the file subsystem

fils are represented by **inode**(index node), which is an internal representation containig, a file 
description of the disk layout, and other info(permission, owner...).
each file have only one inode but it could have multible links(fancy name for pointers).
there is two more data structers for files in unix : *file table* and *user file descriptor table*,
file table is a global kernal structure and the user file thing is allocated per process.
when a process opens or creates a file,  the kernal allocates an entry in each table, corresponding
the that file inode in the three structures.
where **file table** keeps track of the bytes off set the user next read or write and the access rights,
the **user file descriptor** identifies all the files for a process.

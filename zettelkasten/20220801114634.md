# Control Structures

Each declaration to ever happen, happens at the **Bloc Level**, any thing declared outside that the Bloc is acculy gonna be declared into
the **Package Block**, and any valid imnport statement will import files from the **File Block(scope)**, and each set of curly bracets({}) define a bloc.
U can add variable shadowing detection by using the *shadow-linter*.

1. if statement, 
```
  n:= rand.Intn(10)
  if n == 0{
    fmt.ptintln("thats a zero for ya")
  } else if n > 15{
    fmt.ptintln("big boy here")
  } else {
    fmt.ptintln("small boi is no good")
  }
 ```
 2. for staement, we have 4 ways of doing and it has the **break** and **continue** keywords.
  * ``` for i:=1 ; i<20 ;i++{}```
  * ``` for i>10 {}```
  * ``` for  {} ```
  * ``` 
     evenVals := []int{2,4,6,8,10}
      from i, v := range evenVals {
        fmt.println(i, v)
      }
    ```

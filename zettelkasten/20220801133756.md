# Functions ton ton ton taaaa

go does not have named and optional params, so we have to sumilate then into reality. << go's take on the subject>> funtions shouldn't have alot of params 
in the first place so it u find yourself in that situation ur probably overcomlicationg things.

* to emulate named and optional params create some struct and pass it as an argument to that function.
* go supports **variadic params**, and they must be last when declaring functions, and are indecated by dots(...).

the **defer** keyword, we attach the clean up code(*close a file , close a connection, free some reasors.*) in a function to it, wherther ot was completed seccesfully
or now. Defer can be used to change to returned value by using named returns(errors usually).
  * this is how to use defer with closure: 
  ```
    defer func(){
       if err ==  nill{
         err= tx.Commit()
       }else{
         tx.Rollback()
       }
    }()
   ```
   
 The go language is a *call by value language*(please be careful with the pointers useage ffs).

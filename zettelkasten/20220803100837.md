# Pointers, the great evil

go's pointer syntax is just like c/c++ pointer's syntax, but without the arithmethics(they are not allowed), **&** is the address operator
and **\*** is the derefrecing operator(gets the value of a pointer).
make sure to check for null(*nil*) pointer value before derefrencing becouse it cuases a panic.

the built-in function **new** is used to create a new pointer variable of a type ``` var x = new(int) ``` or you can use a & with
structs to get the same result as ``` var strc = &SomeStruct{} ```.

pointers  indicate mutable params, if you want params to behave as if the were pased by refrence instead of value just use pointers( but  you probably dont want to over do it)

you should avoid using maps as input params and return values, since they are implemented using as a pointer.

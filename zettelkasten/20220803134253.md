# Types, Methods and Interfaces

Methods are declared by the following syntax ``` func (var SomeType) string() string{ return "string" } ```, methods **cant be overloaded** in go,
go does not support inhertance so to achive subtyping we use **Composition**, and it is applyed via embedding.

**Iota type** allows us to assugn an increaming values to a set of constants.
```
type TheIotaType int

const (
   Uncategorized TheIotaType = iota //will be given the value 0 at compile time
   Personal // value == 1
   Spam     // value == 2
   Social   // value == 3
)

```

**interfaces** are type safe duck-typing, which means they allow us to make use of one of the selling features of go, *implicit interfaces*,
which simply means that if a type have some implememntaion of the methods listed in an interface declaration, that type is automaticaly(implictly)
implying that interface.
```
  type Stringer interface {
     String() String
  }
  ```

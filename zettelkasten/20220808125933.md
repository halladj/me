# Errors baby, errors

* **the Basics**, the basic thing is, it should be there in every function u write in golang an error return, a *nil* 
is returned as the error value if evey thing is smooth and an Error value is retuned if something wrong happens. 
Go does not have a structure to detect if an error has accured so u need to use *if* statement with 
each function call<< i know its painfull at first>>. error is an built in interace that implements one method *Error*.

* use **strings** as errors.

* Wrapping errors is a great way to give info and the context, whem done multible times, a **error chain** is created, id u need 
to error chain u need to implemtn the Unwrap method, it takes no params and returns an error.

* Wrapping errors is great but u cant use == to compare them can u, we use **Is** and **As**, to achive that.

* **Panics** is a way of gacefull exit from a function call and then, exits the whole application after running the *defer* 
attached to it, and there is a built in function **recover** that runs in the defer if a panic happens to either shotdown more
gracefully or prevint shuttingdow at all.

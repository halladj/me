# Packages and Modules

library mamangment is made up of three main concepts: **repositories**, **modules** and **packages**. a *repository* is some folder in 
a virsion controll system, *module* is the root of some go application or a library stored in some version controll system(repository).
every module has a unique global identifier that represent it, in go that id is this ***path to its repo***.

to have a proper module in go the root of ur application must have, **`` go.mod ``** file at the root of its repo and its created automaticaly
by the command ```go mod```.

how does the import work ???, in go we use the keyword import to access the exporeted identifiers(constants, funcs, structs, ...), 
so the question becomes how to export a identifier in golang, **anything that starts with an uppercase letter is part of ur package API**,
which means its acciesible to import statements.

if we have a colliding package names in out imports, we can use allias to get rid of the ambiguity code sample:
```
import (
    allias "pathto_package1/my_package"
    "pathto_package2/my_package"
    )
```

go has special functions called **init**, that run when the package is refrenced for *the first* time, it's should be used explicitly to 
initilize immutable state the package won't have access to otherwise,  and also we should always only create one single init function,
eventhou the compiler allows as to create more that one.

we can use ``` go get github.com/path_to1/package ``` to spicify the version of imported packages in our depenencies.

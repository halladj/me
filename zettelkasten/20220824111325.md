# Distrubuted systems and unix

* one of the main design end goal of a distrubed system
  is transparancy, meaning that a user have no idea
  on which machine a process is runnig or where that 
  data is stored nor should it matter if is was being 
  replecated, and transparancy is one of the main concepts unix culture endurse by keeping it alive since the 
  first unix of them all.:
    1- this is visibale in which resources are accessed
       though one unifying file-sysem inteface, hidding
       the diffrent storage devices and mediums.

* for distributed systems partial failures are inavadable
so taking care of them should not be treated with 
careless approach, thats also another corner where unix
culture endures failing load providing the system with
all the into to treat such failure.

* ***out of context*** **what middleware** does in an
  distributed system is:
    1. communication
    2. trasnscation
    3. service conposition
    4. reliability

# Distributed Systems Architecture

distributed systems are complex systems by nature, so we must pay close attention
to there architecture to have a better understanding how they work and how would 
a system scale. But there must be a distenction between the **physical architecture**
(system architecture)and a **logical** one(software architecture).

*software architecture* is the logical organization of a distributed system into software
components, this field has matured enough so it is considired a standered to adopt
some architecture when designing a system. *systems* are configured or formulated as
components, a **component** is a moduler unit with well-defined required and provided
interaces that is replaceable within it's enviorment. the medium to mediates communication
, coordination among components is called the **connector**.

Over the years serveral styles have amireged, the most important ones for distributed
systems are:
  * Layered Arhcitecture
  * Object-Based Architecture
  * Resource-Centered Architecture
  * Event-Based Architecture
  
but we must put in perspective that in real-life senarios more that one styles are
combined into one system in order to achive cet funtionality.

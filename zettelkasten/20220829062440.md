# its open source why license

## what is a license

A copyright license is a legal permission given by the
work owner(_Licensor_) to others (_Licensees_), and that
said license will rule the activities allowed to be taken
by the lincesees on some work, and in most cases the
agreement to the license is implite rather that explixit
meaning you have already agreed on by just using that
work.(what is a license).

## why use a license

using a work does not just mean basic ustilization, it
also implyes the abiility of deriving some new work from
it and that that derived work can be anythink from using
a function to ingrating intire applications into new ones
and claiming ownership uppon the entire thing, does this sound fair ??
, so whats a acceptable and whsta not, see the lines
kinda blure here between fair use and plagrazim so some
kind of an agreement must be eshued, and thats where
the copyright license comes into play.

one could say but whats the point of having a license over an 
opensource code or a side project ,of having not having a 
license will eliminate any rights or ownership, so having 
license will protect you from basic usage assumption over your 
work, gining the the licensor the full controll over whats 
acceptable and whts not.

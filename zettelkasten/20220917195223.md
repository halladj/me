# Standered Library stuff maybe

* **I/O Package**, at the heart of the i/o package restes two main interfaces, *Reader* and *Writer*, they both
implemtn only one method, Read for the Reader interface and Write for the Writer interface, and both of they take a **slice**
and a param and return tuple of an **int** and an **error**.
```
type Writer interface{
  Write (p []byte)(int n, err error)
}

type Reader interface{
  Read(p []byte)(int n, err error)
}
```
and we can use this pattern whenever we need to have a spicific type meet such interface (the duck typing my dude),
in this case duck typing an **io.Reader** into an **io.ReadCloser**:

```
type nopCloser struct{
  io.Reader
}
func (n nopCloser) Close() error {return nil}

func NupCloser(r io.Reader) io.ReadCloser {
  return nopCloser{r}
}
```

* **time Package**, there are two main type at the go's time package, **time.Duration** and **time.Time**, 
A time *period* is represnted using Time.Duration which based of int64, with the help of time.Minute and so one for example:
```
d := 2 * time.Hour + 30 * time.Minute // d is of the type time.Duration
```
and these type can be pharsed into string with varios time formats using **time.ParseDuration**.
A moment of time can be represented using the **time.Time**, and we can aquire an instance of the current
time using the **Time.Now*()**.

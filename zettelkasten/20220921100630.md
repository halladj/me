# The Context

Go's context pakage is the way the go language pushed *metadata* to *goroutines* to inflenuance there thread of excution behavoir,
since go can't use *threadlocal* for the reason that go manages it's own threads and not the operating system who's in charge.

* the **metadata** have usually something to do with infividual requests, and they generally can be grouped into to main categories:
 1. metadata data required to correctly process the request &
 2. metadata required to know when to stop process the request.
 
* So context is nothing more than  an instnace that meets the context interface, since go idiomatic encorages explicit data passing 
via function params, we work and use context usually using one if the methods or both, ```context.Background```, and it will return a 
varaible of the type of *context.Context*, but some of the go api's in the standred library does not support context as a param for 
compatibility reasons, but new methods were added to the old types to give context the power to function on them, 
for example the *net/http* was created far before the context package so it does not support as a param, but it can accessed using
```req.Context``` and ```req.WithContext``` that will provide an inctance of the context and the latter will wrappe around the request
a new modified context. And it can be see in the code snippet:
```
func MiddllwareFunc(handler http.Handler) http.Handler {
  return http.Handler( func(rw http.ResponceWritter, r *http.Request) {
    ctx := req.Context() //GENERATES AN INSTANCE OF THE OLD PASSED DOWN CONTEXT
    req = req.WithContext(ctx) //WRAPPES A NEW REQUEST WITH THE CONTEXT OPJECT
    handler.ServeHTTP()
  }
}
```

* some of the functionality that can be achived with the context is
1.  **Cancelleation**, and it can be used by generating a context
vai the ```context.WithCancellation``` and ```context.CancelFunc```.

2. **Timers & TimeOuts**, there is sooo many ways to do soo,  just check the docs champ.
3. lastly **pasing Values**, such as *jwt* and authInfo and *form & JSON values*.

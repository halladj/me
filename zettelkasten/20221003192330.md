# Go testing 

Go's testing is actually split into two part, *libraries* and *tooling*. Go includes a testing package
called *testing*, and has `go test` as a tool to run and automate the entire testing env. In code 
tests code is written along side the production  code so they infact share the same package so all
the unimported code can be tested effectively.

this is a quick example on how to write and run tests in go:
```
// adder/adderc.go
// THE FUNCTIO TO BE TESTED
func addNumbers(x, y int) {
  return x + x
}

//  adder/adder_test.go
// THE TEST FUNCTION IN ANOTHER FILE
func Test_addNumbers(t *testing.T){
  result := addNUmbers(2,3)
  if resualt != 5 {
    t.Error("incorrrect result: expected 5, got", resualt)
  }
}
```

* So as we can notice every test file name must end with a *_test.go*, and they take a single
  param usually named *t* of the type `*testing.T`, and it does not return anything.
  When it comes to the naming convention, we usually put *Test* then concatenate the name of the function 
  in question, we can squeeze in and underscore *_* if the function is unimported.
  
* **testing.M** gives as a really neat method to partition our test in the case we need some set up values 
  or want a multipart test to run in some spicific sequance. An exmaple would serve better than me explaining 
  won't it ??.
  ```
  var testTime time.Time
  
  func TestMain(m *testing.M){
    fmt.println("Set up stuff for tests here")
    testTime := time.Now()
    exitVal := m.Run()
    fmt.println("Cleanup stuff after tests here")
    os.Exit(exitVal)
  }
  
  func TestFirst(t testing.T){
    fmt.Println("TestFirst uses stuff set up in TestMain", testTime)
  }
  
  func TestSecound(t *testing.T){
    fmt.Println("TestSecound also uses stuff setup in TestMain ", testTime)
  }
  ```
  plus we can also use *t.Cleanup()* to do any cleaing and freeing any resources such as opened files 
  and so on, it serves the same purpose as defer in regualr go code, and lastly go give the ability 
  to store data to use in test in such directory called *testdata*, every test must has a subdirectory
  named like that to be used based on the relative path to its parent (where the test file is).
  
  * google have blesed the community with a package that will be in great benifit to writting tests
  om compaund types, the package name is *go-cmp* it equalt to the deepEqual on the reflec package but
  it gives a consise description on the differences between both of them.

# Strings datatype in Haskell

<sup>extention for [into to haskell](https://github.com/halladj/me/blob/main/zettelkasten/20221003192330.md)</sup>

Haskell supports multible numerical data types and boolean data type but it also has
a support for *Strings* and Char<character>. We can use the command  `:type 'a'` in
the REPL to find out the type of `'a'`, and we get the result `'a' :: Char`, which
reads as *"has the type"*.
  
* **printing strings**, so we usually use one of the two predefined functions, 
  `putStr` and `putStrln`, im sure you can fill gabs let's be honest.
  String concatenation can be achived via the operator `someString ++ otherString`,
  and example is alyaws lovely: 
  ```
  hello :: String
  hello = "Hello"
  
  world :: String
  world = "World !"
  
  main :: IO()
  main = do
    putStr seconedGreating
    where seconedGreating = concat [hello, " ", world]
  ```
  
  * **local definition** & **global definition**, a variable is said to be declared
  globally is when it is not nested with in any other experssion, by contrast, 
  local definition means nesting such declaration with in some other expression 
  using *let* or *where* keywords.

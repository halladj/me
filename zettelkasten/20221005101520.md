## Go Testing 2.0

<sup>extention for [Go testing](https://github.com/halladj/me/blob/7cf0648c19567129d21ea8423da58268f857b1fe/zettelkasten/20221003192330.md)</sup>

* **Code Covarage** is a vary usefull to use to check if we have missed ant abvious
  cases where bugs can arise. Just by adding the flag `-cover` to the command `go test`
  just like so `go test -cover` we will trigger it to function, and we can save the
  code coverage to file using the following flag `-coverprofile=<filename>.out`.
  
  just keep in mind that this is a great tool to check for edge cases and that all
  of the lines of code are accualy getting tested but IT DOES NOT MEAN THIS IS NO BUGS
  these are two different quentions that have different answers.
  
* **Benchmarks**, go have a benchmaring package that will help us determine how
  fast or slow our code is, and that package is a part of the tesing package.
  *"Remember always, premature optimization is the root of all evil."*
  benchmarks function always start with the word `Benchmark<SomeFunction>`,and
  take only a single param that is `testing.B`, this type has all the basic functionality
  of the regualr `testing.T` plus some benchmaring support.
  
  to run the benchmarking functions we use the flag `-bench`, to run all of them
  use `-bench=.`, and also to have a full description of the memory allocations and
  all stick in there the following flag `-benchmem`.
  The benchmark function MUST follow this syntax thingy(i dont make the rules fam).
  ```
  // VARS WHERE TO STORE RESULTS 
  var blackhole int
  
  func BenchmarkFileLen1(b *testing.B) {
    for i := 0; i < b.N; i++{ 
      result, err := FIleLen("someRandomFIle.txt")
      if err != nill {
        t.Fatel()
      }
      blackhole = resualt
    }
  }
  ```
  **notice** that the loop that have the `i=0` to `i < b.N` must be present at all
  benchmark functions soo the calculation be acculty precise and correct.

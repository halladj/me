## Advanced Go testing

* **Stubs**, so far we only have written code that will test go functions,
  but this is generally not the case when it comes to real code, because
  code is usually filled with dependencies, so how do we go about testing
  abstrations (functions defenetions & interfaces).
  well this is an example on how to test *stubs*:
  ```
  type Processor struct{
    Solver MathSolver
  }
  
  type MathSolver interface {
    Resolve (ctx context.Context, expression string) (float64, error)
  }
  
  func (p Processor) ProcessExpression(cnx context.Context, r io.Reader){
    curExpression, err := readToNewLine(r)
    if err != nil{
      return 0, err
    }
    
    if len(curExpression) == 0{
      return 0, errors.New("no expression to read")
    }
    
    anwser, err := p.Solver.Reslove(ctx, curExpression)
    return anwser, err
  }
  
  type MathSolverStub struct{}
  
  func (ms MathSolverStub) Resolve(cnx context.Context, expression string)(float64, error){
    //logic
    return someValue, err
  }
  ```
  and here is how to should be tested:
  ```
  func TestProcessorProcessExpression(t *testing.T){
    p := Processor{MathSolverStub{}}
    in := string.NewReader(
      `2 + 2 * 10 
       ( 2 + 2 ) * 10
       ( 2 + 2 ) * 10
      `)
    
    data := []float{22, 40 , 0, 0}
    for _, d := range data {
      resualt, err := p.ProcessExpression(context.BackGround(), in)
      
      if err != nil{
        t.Error(err)
      }
      
      if err != d {
        t.Errorf("Expected resualt %f got %f", d, resualt)
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  now imagine an interface with a ton of methods init, so how would you
  test it, there are two patterns used in this case. 
  the first choice is when u don't need to test every single method in there
  , so we just embed that interface into a stub and only implemnt that ones 
  we care to test, where as when we want to test evert last method that is 
  defined on that inteface a better approach is to proxy method calls to
  function fields.
  
  
* **httptest**, we testing a HTTP service, we usually also need a clint or
  something in thoese lines, so the package httptest provides tooling to
  make creating stubs a bit more easier.
  
  a light wieght demonstration would server a good exmple and for more info
  checkup the docs.
  
  ```
  type RemoteSolver{
    MathServerURL string
    Client *http.CLient
  }
  
  // we use the httptest to provide a client and url for testing
  // the cleint is a struct that would respond to the test using a
  //defined Hnadlefunc
  func (rs RemoteSolver) Resolve(cnx context.Context, expression string)(float64, error){
    req, err := http.NewRequestWithContext(ctx, "GET", "some url")
    if err != nil{
      return 0, err
    }
    
    resp, err := res.CLientDo(req)
    if err != nil{
      return 0, err
    }
    
    deffer resp.Body.Close()
    //BUISNESS LOGIC
  }
  
  server := httptest.NewServer( http.HandelFunc( SomeHandelFuncToTreatTheRequest ))
  
  defer server.Close()
  
  rs := RemoteSolver{
    MathServerURL: server.URL,
    Client: server.Client(),
  }
  // TESTING logic using the <<rs>> object
  
  ```

* **Intergration Test** are very importtant and they should never be neglected
  just because httptest exits, unit tests using httptest are important to
  make sure that that service buissness logic is working as intended but
  we must also see how service would play togeather in production and the
  must usefull way to test that is vai *integration tesing*.
  
  we can use build tags by writting `// +build` in the first line of
  an integration test to prevent it from running every time and only run
  when the code that it depends on is availabe.
  
  and to run them we can do the following, in the test file write 
  `// +build integration`, and in the terminal, 
  `go test -tags integration -v ./..`, to spicify the path for the dependecies.

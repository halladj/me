## Java IO

Regardless of the kind of software you are writting. reading and/or wrtting data is something
that you will have to deal with eventually, java has an offical api to deal with
input output named *java.io*.

If you go ahead now to check out java.io you will find a vast amount of classes that
can be rather confusing, so how do we choose the proper class for our task and also
how to extend that api and create our own plugins ?.

* Before we get to the wonderland of *java.io*, we need to get down one last concept
  that is **Streams**, streams are an endless data flow that can be bidirectional,
  so we can write to an *input stream* and read from an *output stream*, and lastly
  streams in java have two categories: *byte based* and *character based* streams.
  
* now with java classes the actually handles input/output operations, the are 4 main
  class that server as the *super classes* to  all the other ones, and they are classified
  as mentioned before, byte based and character based:
  
    1. **character based** : *Reader* & *Writer*.
    2. **Byte based** classes are: *InputStream* & *OutputStream*,
       Finally the byte based classes have a *wrapper* that turns them into
       character based, and these classes are: *InputStreamReader* that turns an *InputStream*
       into a *Reader*, and *OutputStreamWriter* that turns an *OutputWriter* into a *Writer*.
       Keep in mind that these are super classes so **any sub-classes** can be also be 
       wrapped with OutputStreamWriter and InputStreamReader.

* All the other java.io classes that extends the main 4 classes exist to adresse
  various purposes, and the main ones can be summiraized in the following list:
  1. File access
  2. Network access
  3. Buffer access and buffering(internale memory buffers)
  4. Reading and Writing Text
  5. Reading and Writing Primitive daratypes and Objects

## Defining Functions 

* **new from old**, simply combining one or more pre-exiting funtions to define a new
  function for example: 
  ```
  even :: Integral a => a -> Bool
  even n = n `mod` 2 == 0
  ```
  
* **condintional expressions** are used to allow us to choose on of many possible
  resualts, and they also can be nested so we could write something like this: 
  ```
  signum :: Int -> Int
  signum n = if n < 0 then -1 else
                  if n == 0 then 0 else 1
  ```
* **Guarded equations**, are haskell's anwser to switch case, so basiclly we define
  a set of guards(logical expressions) that define with resualt is returned as follows:
  ```
  signum n | n < 0      = -1 // | IS READ AS such as
           | n == 0     = 0
           | otherwise  = 1   // otherwise AS A PRE-DEFINED AS TRUE SO USUALLY IS USED TO END A SEQUENCE
  ```
  
* **patten matching**, in whihc a syntactic expressions called patterns is used to 
  choose between sequence of resualts of the same type, such as if the first resualt is
  matched a result is choosen, otherwise the seconed is matched and its resualt is choosen
  and so on.
  ```
  not :: Bool -> Bool
  not False = True
  not True = False
  ```
  
* **List pattern**, it's just a glorified pattern matcing using lists. 
  ```
  test :: [Char] -> Bool 
  test ('a':_) = True // WE MUST USE () SO WE DONT MISS THE EXECUTION ORDER
  test _ = False      // _ IS A CATCH ALL THINGY
  ```
* **lambda expresions** or also known as nameless functions, it can be used to define
  functions that are only mentioned once for exmaple:
  ```
  odd :: Int -> Int
  odd n = map (\x -> x*3 + 1) [0..n-1]
  ```
  
  or it can used to formalise the meaning of curried funtion definitions:
  ```
  add :: Int -> Int -> Int
  add \x -> (\y -> x+y )
  ```

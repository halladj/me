## List Comperhensions

* **Comperhension** are borrowed from math, such that
  we can define the following list from: 
  ```
  [x^2 | x <- [1..5]]
  ```
  the symbole *|* is read as *such that*, and *<-* is 
  read as *is drawn from*, and the expression 
  `x <- [1..5]` is called a **generator**.
  Also a list comperhension can have multible generators
  seperated by commas such:
  ```
  [ (x,y) | x <- [1,2,3], y <- [4,5] ]
  ```
  also the generators can depend on the values of previos
  generators.

  **Guards**, can be used too by list comperhension, as
  a logical expression used to  filter out values from 
  previos generators, this a great example to show:
  ```
  factors :: Int -> [Int]
  factors n = [x | x <- [1..n], n `mod` x == 0]

  prime :: Int -> Boll
  prime n = factors n == [1, n]
  ```
  (Eq a) => a 
  means any a's in the function parameters should
  be members of the class Eq, which can be evaluated
  as equal or unequal.

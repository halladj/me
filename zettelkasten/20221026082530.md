## Recusive Funtions in Haskell

haskell covers recusion basic concepts and more, it is the  basic looping
mechanism in haskell as there is no for while bs, haskell also includes 
miltible recursion and mutual recurion.

* an example on recursive functions with lists, try to stay with me
  ```
  insert :: Ord a => a -> [a] -> [a]
  insert x [] = [x]
  insert x (y:ys) | x <= y = x : y :ys 
                  | otherwise = y : insert x ys
  ```

* mutual recursion is when two functions are defined recursivley interms 
  of each other for a simple example check this code out:
  ```
  even :: Int ->Bool
  even = True
  even n = odd (n-1)
  
  odd :: Int -> Bool
  odd 0 = False
  odd n = even (n-1)
  ```

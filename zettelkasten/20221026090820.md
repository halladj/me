## Higher order functions in haskell
using higher order funtions in haskell is considered as a main featuer 
for the power it provides to the programmer, by alowing common programming
patterns to be encapsulated as functions within the language itself.

as it is usually used to write domain spisific langauges(mini-lang) within haskell
itself.

* the **Map** function, man you know what the map function is, 
  ```
  map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
  map f xs = [ f x | x <- xs]
  
  map (+1) [1, 2, 3, 4] // ADDS +1 TO ALL ELEMENTS
  ```
  but it does not end here, we can apply map to itself to process nested 
  lists( here is where you start scratching your head).
  ```
  map (map (+1)) [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]
  ```

* **filter**, takes a predicate as argument and a list.
  ```
  filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
  filter p xs = [x | x <- xs, p x] // IT IS A GUARD << p x >>
  ```

* **folder** function, many functions that take a list as argument can be
  defined using: 
  ```
  f [] = v
  f (x:xs) = x # f xs // WHERE # IS ANY OPPERATOR SUCH +
  ```
  the folder function encapsulates this pattern of recusion for 
  defining function so these two functions are equevlent:
  ```
  sum [] = 0 
  sum (x:xs) = x + sum(xs)
  
  sum xs = folder (+) 0 xs
  ```
  it can be thought as replacing the cons operator in a list by the function f 
  the folder function is defined itself can be definedd using  recursion:
  ```
  folder :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
  folder f v [] = v
  folder f v (x:xs) = fx (foldr f v xs)

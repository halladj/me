## More haskell higher order functions

* the **foldr** function, many functions that take a list as an argument can be defined 
  using the following simple pattern:
  ```
  f [] = v
  f (x:xs) = x # f xs
  ```
  the function *foldr* encapsulates this pattern of recursion for defintin function
  on lists, with the operator # and the value v as an argument.
  the *foldr* is used explicitly with operators that are associate to the right,
  for the left associate operators the function **foldl** can be used.
  
* the **composition** operator "." return the composition of funtions as a single 
  funtion, it can be defined as follows and some exmaples are supplied:
  ```
  (.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> c)
  f . g = /x -> f (g x)
  
  odd n = not ( even n )
  odd n = not . even 
  
  twice = f x = f ( f x )
  twice f = f . f 
  ```

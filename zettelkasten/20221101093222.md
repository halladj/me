# Unsafe Go

* **reflect** is package of go that allows us to examine, modify and create variables
  , functions and structs at *runtime*. because some times we work with uncertine type
  for example data thtat was not there when the program first started, a network request maybe.
  
  Almost reflect is used explicitly with accessing and formatting data that is being
  imported or exported out of a go program.
  
  reflect is part of go's main library, and is built mainly on the idea of 3 concepts:
  types, kinds and values.
  
  1. *types* it's exactly what it sounds like, it defins the properities of a variable what it
     can hold  and how it can be interacted with. example:
     ```
     var x int
     
     xt := reflect.TypeOf(x)
     fmt.Println(xt.Name()) // returns int
     
     f := Foo{}
     yt := reflect.TypeOf(y)
     fmt.Println(ty.Name()) // return foo
     ```
  
  2. *kinds*, can be optianed by the method Kind on reflect.Type, which is conatant
     that says what the type is made of - a slice, a map, a pointer, a struct, an interface,
     or any primitive type.
  
  3. and we can also read the values of variables it's self explanatory.'
  
  We can use Reflection to check if an interface's value us nil
  ```
  func hasNoValue(i interface{}) bool {
    iv := reflect.ValueOf(i)
    if !iv.isValid(){
      return true
    }
    
    switch iv.Kind() {
    case reflect.Ptr, reflect.Slice, reflect.Map, reflect.Func, reflect.Funtion:
      return iv.IsNill
    default:
      retrun false
    }
  }
  ```

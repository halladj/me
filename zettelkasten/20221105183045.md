## Go's unsafe is unsafe

the unsafe package is a bit odd since it has three funtions and one type,
and it allows us to manipulate memory.

the functions:
  1. *Sizeof* is function that takes in a variable as param and retuns,
     how many bytes it uses.
  2. *Offsetof* which takes in a field of a struct and returns the offset
     from that start of that struct till that begning of that field.
  3. *Alignof* which takes in a field or a variable and returns the byte 
     alignment it requires.

the type :
  * *unsafe.Pointer*, is a spicail pointer that can point and be converted
    from and to any other time.


*Use unsafe to Convert External Binary Data*, its used usually for, 
 conecting and integration with operating system and to optimize performance.
 for example of optimization, reading and writting to a network connection ,
 we can gain a segnificent time by using it in a program where reading and writing
 is used havealy.
 
 another area where it is used, is in strings manipolation since there are
 implmented using pointers then we can use *reflect* and *unsafe* to get
 creattive.

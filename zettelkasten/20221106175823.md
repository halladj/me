## Declaring types and classes in Haskell

* **Type Declarations**, the simplest way to declare a type in haskell,
  is to intreduce a new name for an existing type, using the *type*,
  mechanism of haskell.
  for example:
  ```
  type String = [Char]
  ```
  but keep in mind the name of a type must start with an uppercase letter.
  Keep in mind that type declarations can not be recusive whereas, they
  can be nested, in the sense that one type can be declared interms of another.
  ```
  type Pos = (Int, Int)
  
  type Trans = Pos -> Pos
  ```
  lastly type declaration can *paramaterised* by other types, if a function
  were to manipulate pairs of values of the same type, we could declare
  a synonym for such pairs:
  ```
  type pair a = (a, a)
  ```

* **Data Declaration**, A completely new type, as opposed to synonym of an
  existing type, can be declared by specifyinh its values using the *data*
  mechanism. for example:
  ```
  data Bool = False | True
  ```
  the symble "|" is read as *or* and the new values of the type are called
  *constructors*, and they also must start with an uppercase letter.
  The constructors(also known as constructor functions) in a data decalarations 
  can also have arguments, and these functions exist purely for the purpose of
  building pieces of data.
  
* **recursive types**, new types delared using data & newtype, can be recursive,

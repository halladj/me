# CLASSES

python has a fully-fleged object-oriented system, suitable for oop,
were it supports most oop concepts (inheritance, polymorpism, ...), but since it
is is an interpreted language, so its all dynamic and using ducktyping
here are some featurs that pythons oop supports, and will go on more details in future
zattels:

* We start with defing a class ,declaring attributes and methods, and inheritance:

```
class Hamza():

# this is an intializer and not a constructor, 
# multible inheritance is a thing 
  def __init__(self):
    # adding attribute first name to the class
    self.name = "hamza"

  def printName():
    print(self.name)

class HamzaSon(Hamza):

# super is super u know that
  def __init__(self, lastName):
    super().__init()
    self.lastName= lastName

# overriding
  def printName():
    print(self.name, self.lastName)
```

* Atrribute access, well python has mustly only direct access, so it all visible everywhere
  but we can get around it using the *proprety()* at the end of class definition:
    ```
    class Duck():
      def __init__(self, input):
        self.hiddenField= input

      def get_name(self):
        return self.hiddenField

      def set_name(self, value):
        self.hiddenField= value

      name= proprety(get_name, set_name)
    ```

    or we can replace it with the decorators *@proprety* & *@name.setter*

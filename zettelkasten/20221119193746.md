# Java networking

Java offers a relativley easy to use networking API that make it easy to
to communicate via TCP/IP or even UDP.
Although java networing API allows us to open and close connects, all
communication happens through *java.io* classes.

* in order to connect to a server over the internet, you have to create
  `java.net.Socket` and connect it to the server.
  *1. creating a Socket*:
  ```
  // use ip address
  Socket socket = new Socket("127.0.0.1", 80);
  
  // OR USE DOMAIN NAME
  Socket socket = new Socket("jenkov.com", 80)
  ```
  *2. Writing to a Socket*
  ```
  Socket socket  = new Socket("127.0.0.1", 80);
  OutputStream out = new socket.getOutputStream();
  
  out.write("string baby".getBytes());
  out.flush();
  out.close();
  
  socket.close();
  ```
  
  *3. Reading from a Socket*:
  ```
  Socket socket = new Socket();
  InputStream in = new socket.getInputStream();
  
  int data = in.read();
  // read that data baby
  
  in.close();
  socke.close();
  ```
  

* to implemnt a java server that listens for incomming connections via 
  TCP/IP we need to use `java.net.ServerSockt`, listening for incomming
  connections:
  ```
  ServerSocket sc = new ServerSocket(9000);
  
  boolean isStopped = false;
  while (!isStopped){
    Socket clientSocket = sc.accept();
    // DO SOMETHING WITH THE SOCKET
  }
  ```

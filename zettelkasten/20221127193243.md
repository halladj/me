## Guide to IPv6 Configuration:

* IPv6 is not enable by defualt on router so we must runt the commnad in *config* mode
  `ipv6 unicast-routing`, the command only enables ipv6 packets forwading
  so w still have to turn ipv6 on every and each interface that must use it, using
  `ipv6 enable`.
  
  for *cisco* routers enabling IPv6 on an inteface automatically configurs 
  an **link-local** IPv6 address, which allow as to communicate with IPv6
  devices *on the same network*.
  
  the command `show running-config` is used to verify IPv6 configuration, 
  and the command `show ipv6 interface gigabyteEthernet 3/1`, is used to
  check the cofiguration of IPv6 for a single interface.
  
  global addresses can be configured using the command `ipv6 address [ADDRESS]`, and
  the address we can spicify the full 128bit adress, or we can spicy only the network
  prefix and use the **eui-64** option which allows it to configure it own address.
  
* Dynamic unicast address configuration can be done using of two methods, either
  *statefull DHCP* using the command `ipv6 address dhcp`, of *stateless SLAAC*,
  via the command `ipv6 address autoconfig`.

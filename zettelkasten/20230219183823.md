# PL/SQL(1-2)

### Acheritecture of PL/SQL:
* **PL/SQL Engine**, the PL/SQL compilation and runtime system is an engine that compiles and runs
  PL/SQL units.
  The engine can be installed in the database or in an application development tool, such as Oracle forms.
  In either environment, the PL/SQL engine accepts as input any valid PL/SQL unit. the engine runs
  procedural statements, but sends SQL statements to the SQL engine in the database.
  

* **PL/SQL Units & Compilation Params**, PL/SQL units are effected by PL/SQL compilation params
  Different PL/SQL units have different params.
  A PL/SQL unit is one of these:
  1. **PL/SQL Anonymouse block**
  2. **FUNCTION**
  3. **LIBRARY**
  4. **PACKAGE**
  5. **PACKAGE BODY**
  6. **PROCEDURE**
  7. **TRIGGER**
  8. **TYPE**
  9. **TYPE BODY**

  The *compile-time* values of the params are stored with the meta-data of *each* stored
  PL/SQL unit, which means that you can reuse those values when you explicitly recompile that unit.

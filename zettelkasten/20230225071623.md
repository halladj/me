# PL/SQL(2), Language Fundamentals:

1.  **Character Set**: The byte represnetation of each character is called a *character unit*, and a set
of character codes is called a *character set*. Oracle databases support a character ser and a national
character set. PL/SQL also supports these sets.
    * Data base character set: they are used to represent: Stored source txt PL/SQL untits.
      Character values of data type *CHAR*, *VARCHAR*, *CLOB*, and *LONG*.
      And it is consistant of the following: **latin letters**, **Decimal digits**, **Punctuation characters**, and **Whitespaces**.
  
    * National Characters set: Used to represent character values of data types *NCHAR*, *NVARCHAR2*, and *NCLOB*.
  
  
2.  **Lexical Units**, They are the smallest **individual componenets**: *Delimiters*, *Identifiers*, *Literals*, *Progmas*, 
    *Comments*, and *Whitespaces*.
    
    * *Delimiters*, a character or a set of characters that has a special meaning in PL/SQL.
    
    * *Identifiers*, the name PL/SQL **elements** which include: Constants, Cursors, 
      Exceptions, Keywords, Labels, Package, Reserved words, Subprogrames, Types, and Variables.
      
    * *Literals*, it is a value that is neither represented by an identifier nor calculated from other values.
    
    * *Pragmas*, is an instruction to the compiler that it processes at compile time. A pragma begins with the reserved word
      PRAGMA followed by the name of the pragma. 
      
    * *Comments* one liners like ``` -- this is a one line comment``` or a multi-liner like
    ```
    /*
    this
    is 
    a
    comment
    */
    * *Whitespcaes*
    
3.  **Declaration**, A declarations *allocates* storage space for a value of a spicific data types, and
    names the storage localion with a lebal so we can reference it.
    there are 5 main functiaonalities we can do in an declaration block which are:
    * Declaring variables.
    * Declareing Constants.
    * Intial values for both varialble and constants.
    * NOT NULL Constraints.
    * Declaring items using the %TYPE Atrribute.
    
    this example illostracts the whole thing:
    ```
    DECLARE
      account_id  INTEGER(4) NOT NULL := 9999;    -- NOT NULL
      credit_limit    CONSTANT  REAL  := 500.5;   -- Constant
      
      counter    INTEGER;                         -- Gets NULL as intial value
        
    BEGIN
      NULL;
    END;
    
    ```

4.  **References to Identifiers**, when referencing an identifier, you use a name that is either simple, 
    qualified, remote, or both qualified and remote.
    
    * *Simple Name*, of an identifier is the name in its declaration.
    * *Used In a Named Unit*, if it was used in a named PL/SQL unit its gonna have
    ```unit_name.simple_identifier_name```
    * *qualified remote name*, we would use
    ```unit_name.simple_identifier_name@remote_database_adress```

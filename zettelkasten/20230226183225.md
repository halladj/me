# PL/SQL(2-2), Language Fundamentals:

5.  **Scope and Visibility of Identifiers**:
    The **Scope** of an identifier id the region of PL/SQL unit from which you can reference the identifier.
    The **Visibility** of an identifier is the region of a PL/SQL unit from which you can reference the
    identifier without *qulififying it*.

    An identifier is **Local** to the PL/SQL unit it was declared in, but we say it is **global** to the *subunits*.
    But if a subunit *redeclares* a global identifier, then inside the subunit, both identifiers are in scope, but only the local identifier is visibal.
  
    We can not declare the same identifier in the same PL/SQL block.
    Some of the methods used to Qualify an identifier:
    * *With BLOCK label*
      ```
      <<outer>>
      DECLARE
        birthdate DATE := TO_DATE('09-AUG-70', 'DD-MON-YY');
      BEGIN
        DECLARE
          birthdate DATE := TO_DATE('29-SEP-70', 'DD-MON-YY'); -- HERE HERE
        BEGIN
          IF  birthdate = outer.birthdate THEN
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Same Birthdate');
          ELSE
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Different Birthday');
          END IF;
        END;
      END:
      ```
    * *With Sub-program name*:
      ```
      -- we use a similar notation but
      -- we do FUNCTION_NAME.identifier
      -- or    PROCEDURE_NAME.identifier
      ```
      
  
  6.  **Assigning Values to Variables**:
      After declaring a variable we can assign it value using one of these methods:
      1.  Using the *assignment statement* to assign it the value of an expression.`variable_name := expression;`
      2.  Use the *SELECT INTO* or *FETCH* statement to assign it a value from a table.
          ```
          SELECT select_item   [, select_item   ] ...
          INTO   variable_name [, variable_name ] ...
          FROM   TABLE;
          ```
      3.  Pass it to a *subprograme* as an *OUT* or *IN OUT* param, and then assign the value inside the subprogram.
        ```
        DECLARE
          emp_salary  NUMBER(8, 2);
          
          PROCEDURE adjust_salary (
            emp         NUMBER,
            sal IN OUT  NUMBER,
            adjustment  NUMBER
        ) IS
        BEGIN
          sal  := sal + adjustment;
        END;
        ```
        
  7.  **EXPRESSIONS**: An expression is a combination of one or more values, operators, and SQL
      functions that evaluates to a value.
      
      An expression always returns a single value. The simplesg expression, in order of increasing complexty are: 1) A single constant variable,
      2) a unary operator and its signle operand, 3) a binary operator and its two operands.

      
      * **Concatenation Operator**, it is notaed as (`||`), and it appends one string to another, and it ignores null operands.
      * **Operator Precedence**,  it is either binary or unary operator, such as: `**, +, -, /, IN, NOT, AND`.
      * **Short-Curcuit**, when evaluating a logical expression, PL/SQL uses it to *stop*, evaluating the expression
        as soon as it can determine the resualt. Therefore it alows for writting code that otherwise would couse errors.
      * **CASE Expressions**, old fashion c like switch case.
        ```
        CASE selector
          WHEN selector_value_1 THEN result_1
          WHEN selector_value_2 THEN result_2
          ...
          WHEN selector_value_n THEN result_n
          [ ELSE  
            else_result
          ]
        END;
        ```
      
      
      * **SQL Functions**
      * **Reporting ERRORS**
      * [**Conditional Compilation**](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/lnpls/plsql-language-fundamentals.html#GUID-DC23291F-006D-49C4-87DA-6B31F19F162A)

# Docker Storage ( PART 3 ) Bind Mounts:
Bind Mounts have limited functionality compared to *volumes*. When you use a bid mount, a file
or directory on the host machine is mounted into a container. The file or directory is referenced by
its absolute path on the host machine.

## Differences between `-v` and `--mount` behavior:
The only deffirence between them lays in the behavoir of the docker engien when dealing with non-existant files.
when using the `-v` to a bind-mount a file or a directory that does not exist yet, *It is always created as a directory*,
whereas when we use the `--mount` flag, Docker does not create anything instead it raises an Error.

## Start a Container with a bind-mount:
we would do a simple example the flags equally:
```
/*
* Using the --mount flag
*/
$ docker run -d \
  -it \
  -- name devtest \
  -- mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/target,targeet=/app \
  nginx:latest

/*
* Using the -v flag
*/
$ docker run -d -it \
  --name devtest \
  -v "$(pwd)"/target:/app \
  nginx:latest
```
## Mount into a non-empty directory on the container:
If you bind into a non-empty directory on the container, the directory's existing contents are
obsecured by the bind mount. So if we bind to a vital dir into our contianer, it will make that 
container non-funtional.


## Read-only mounts:
For development applications, we would wish to to write to a container, but at some other time
a **read-only** privilage makes more sense.
To make a contianer a read-only we just add `:ro` at the end of the  mount part, example:
```
$ docker run -d -it \
  --name devtest \
  -v "$(pwd)"/target:/app:ro \
  nginx:latest
```

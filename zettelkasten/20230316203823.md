# Docker Storage ( PART 4 ) Bind Mounts:

Volumes and bind mounts let you share files between the host machine and container so that
you can persist data even after the container is stopped.

If we are running docker on *Linux*, a third option is available, a `tmpfs` mount is temporary,
and only persists in the **memory**.

It is useful when storing sensitive data files that we don't want to persist either on *the host*, 
or *the container writanle layer*.

## Limitations of tmpfs mounts:
* The can not be shared across containers.
* Only available when running docker on linux.

## Choose the `--tmpfs` or `--mount` flag:
The `--tmpfs` options is so limited that it does not allow for any configuration options, where is
`--mount` is more verbose and recomended. Also the former can not be used with `Swarm Service`.

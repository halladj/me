## PL/SQL (4-1), Control Statements

PL/SQL has three categories of control statements: *conditional selection statements*,
*loop statements*, sequential control statements*.

In more details:
  1.  **Conditional selection statement**: which run different statements for differnt 
      data values.(IF CASE)
  2.  **Loop statements**: basic loop behavior, LOOP, FOR LOOP, WHILE LOOP. an EXIT statement 
      transphers control to the end of the if statement.  
  3.  **Sequential control statement**: which are not crutial to PL/SQL programming,
      it is the infemous GOTO statement, that should not be used.
      
## Conditional Selection Statement:
we have exactly three flavors of the IF CASE statement:
```
IF THEN
IF THEN ELSE
IF THEN ELSIF
```
and here is an example of them.
```
DECLARE
  PROCEDURE P (sales NUMBER)
  IS
    bonus NUMBER := 0;
  BEGIN 
    IF sales > 50000 THEN
      bonus := 1500;
    ELSIF sales > 35000 THEM
      bonus := 500
     ELSE 
      bonus := 100
  END p;
BEGIN 
  p(50000);
  p(33333);
  p(4343);
END;
```
and lastly we have CASE statemnt:
```
CASE << selector>>
  WHEN <<selector_value1>> THEN <<statement1>>
  WHEN <<selector_value1>> THEN <<statement1>>
  WHEN <<selector_value1>> THEN <<statement1>>
  ELSE <<CATCH_ALL_STATEMENT>>
END CASE;
```

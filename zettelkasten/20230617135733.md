# Docker Networking 

Docker networking refers to the ability of containers to communicate with each other, or to
non-docker Workloads. A container has no idea what kind of networking it is attached to, or
whether its peers are docker containers.

By default, when creating a new container the container does not expose any of its ports to the outside
, Unless we use `--publihs`, `-p` flag to make a **port** available to service. some examples:
  1. `-p 8080:80` Map TCP port 80 of the container to port 8080 of the docker host.
  2. `-p 192.168.1.100:8080:80` Map TCP port 80 on the container to port 8080 on the docker host for
      connections to host IP 192.168.1.100.
  3. `-p 8080:80/udp` Map UDP port 80 in the container to port 8080 on the docker host.
  4. `-p 8080:80/tcp -p 8080:80/udp` Map TCP port 80 in the container to TCP port 8080 on the Docker host,
      and map UDP port 80 in the container to UDP port 8080 on the Docker host.

***Note***: If you want to make a container accessible to other containers, it isn't necessary
to publish the container's ports. **Inter-container communication us enabled by connecting the 
containers to the same network, usually a bridge.

By default, the container gets an IP adreess for every docker network it attaches to. A container
receives an ip adress out of the IP subnet of the network.

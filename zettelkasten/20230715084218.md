# Rootless Mode

Rootless mode allows running containers as a non-root user to mitigate potential vulnerabilities in the daemon and the container runtime.


Rootless mode executes the containers and the runtime in a users namespace, it is very similar to `userns-remap` mode.

refer to the docs for the installation guide, but to put it into *work*, just `$ systemctl --user start docker`sh.
in the client should follow, 
```
$ export DOCKER_HOST=unix://$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/docker.sock
$ docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
```sh

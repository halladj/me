# Day01: The Node API Design Course

## ORM (Object Relational Mapper):

* Prisma is the new cool ORM, at least for the Express Community, it has all the features that needed to make a great nodeJs project( Migrations, etc etc)

* it is a good idea to use (must) **prisma** paired with TypeScript to get the benefit of the type-hinting and the global-types.

* to initialize a **Prisma** project just run `npx prisma init` and a prisma folder will pop ( prisma plug-in recommended )

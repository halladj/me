# Docker Build ( overview & Architecture )

Docker build is one of the most used docker engine features, Whenever you are creating an image you are using docker build.

## Docker Build Architecture 
 Docker build implements a client-server architecture, where:
 * ***Buildx*** is the client and the user interface for running and managing builds.
 
 * ***BuildKit*** is the server, or builder, that handles the build execution.
 
 * **builders** can be on the same machine as the client(Buildx by default now), or it can be on a different system( a single node, cluster, VM, Container, ...)

 * a docker build starts with invocation of `docker build`, BuildX interprets your build command and sends a build request to *BuildKit*, the build request includes:
  1. The DockerFile
  2. Build Arguments
  3. Export options
  4. Caching options

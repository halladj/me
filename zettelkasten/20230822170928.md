# Docker Build (Packaging Software)

* **DockerFile**, Docker Builds by reading the instructions from a DockerFile. A Dockerfile is a text file containing instructions for building your source code.

* the most common instructions are:
  1. `From <image>`, Defines a base for your image.
  2. `Run <command>`, Executes any commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commits the result. `Run` also has a shell form for running commands.
  3. `Workdir <directory>` Sets the working directory for any `Run`, `CMD`, `EntryPoint`, `Copy`, and `ADD` instructions that follow it in the Dockerfile.
  4. `Copy <src> <dest>`, Copies new files or directories from `<src>` and adds them to the filesystem of the Container at the path `<dest>`.
  5. `CMD <command>`, Lets you define the default program that is run once you start the container based on this image. Each Dockerfile has one and only one `CMD`, and only the last `CMD` instance is respected when multiple exist.

## Docker images ( An Example )

Docker images consist from *layers*. Each layer is the result of a build instruction in the DockerFile. Layers are stacked sequentially, each one is a delta representing the changes applied to the previous layer.

* A typical workflow of making a deployment container:
```
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
  return "Hello World!"
```
in order to ship and deploy this application without docker build, you would need to make sure that:
  1. Required Runtime dependencies are installed on the server.
  2. the python code gets uploaded to the server's fileSystem
  3. the Server starts your application, using necessary parameters.

* The following Dockerfile creates a container image, which has all the dependencies installed and the automatically starts your application:
```
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
FROM ubuntu:22.4

# install app dependecies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip
RUN pip install flask==2.1.*

# install app
COPY hello.py /

# final configuration
ENV FLASK_APP=hello
EXPOSE 8080
CMD flask run --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

here is a breakdown:


1. **Base Image**: `FROM ubuntu:22.04`. 
The `FROM` instruction sets your base image to 22.04 release of Ubuntu. All instructions that follow are executed in this base image: *an ubuntu environment*.

2. **Environment Setup**: `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y pyhton3 python3-pip`
This Run instruction executes a shell in Ubuntu that updates the APT package index and install python and pip

3. **Copying Files**: `COPY hello.py /`
It instructs to copy `hello.py` file from the local build context into the root.
A *build context* is the set of files that you can access in Dockerfile instruction such as `COPY` and `ADD`.
After the `COPY` the file is added into the build container filesystem.

4. **Setting Environment Variables**: `ENV FLASK_APP=hello.py`

5. **Exposed Ports**: `EXPOSE 8080`
Marks that our final image has a service listening on port `8080`, it isn't required but it's considered a good practice.

6. **Starting the Application**:`CMD flask run --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080`
Sets the command to be run when the user starts a container based on this image.



## Building

To build a container image using the Dockerfile, we use the `docker build` command:
`$ docker build -t test:latest .`

The single dot `.` at the end of the command set the *build context* to the current directory.

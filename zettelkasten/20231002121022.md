# GUI Compositor & Composition

We define a Compositor class for objects *that can encapsulate* a **formating algirithm**. And
it has a set of methods that lets it know the *what* objects to format and *When* to do the formating.
These objects that are formated and a *subclass* or a *subtype* of the Combosition subclass.

An *Composition* object gets an instance of the compositor class(with some formating algorithm) when created, and it tells the
compositor when to *compose* its objects when it is necessary.

The *Compositor-Composition* split ensures a strong seperation between code that supports the documents 
physical strucure and the code for formating algorithms. Where we can change or optimize the formating
algorithms without changing the code of the objects being composed.

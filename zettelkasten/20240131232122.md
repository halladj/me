# How to convert .NEF (raw image format) to png:


NEF (Nikon Electronic Format) files are RAW image files produced by Nikon cameras, offering high image 
quality and extensive post-processing flexibility but limited compatibility with many software applications. 
Converting NEF files to PNG can facilitate editing and sharing. On Linux, you need tools like *ImageMagick* and *UFRaw* to handle this conversion.
First, install them by running: `sudo apt install ufraw imagemagick`. To batch-convert NEF files using ImageMagick, use 
the command: `for file in *.NEF; do convert "$file" "${file%.NEF}.png"; done`. Alternatively, 
with UFRaw, run: `for file in *.NEF; do ufraw-batch --out-type=png --output="${file%.NEF}.png" "$file"; done`. 
Both methods loop through all NEF files in the directory, converting each to PNG while preserving the original filenames. 
ImageMagick and UFRaw are versatile tools for various image processing tasks beyond simple conversion.

# How To implemnt the IoT Application:

We would have to chose a development stack to write the application,
i would recoomened that we use ***React-Native*** to make the mobile 
client, ***Node-js*** on the back-end to run on the *Controller*,
and when(if) we need a database we could just opt to use **prisma**
to manage the Database (or just use the ORM directly).


For the Service Discovery protocol we are writing our own protocol but we
would need a maner to recover all connected devices on the network for 
that we could use [***mDNS***](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-zeroconf) or ***SSDP***.

After the first phase we would use ***UDP Sockets*** to implement the rest of 
the protocol using either ***Socket.io*** or ***dgram***.

> Our code would rest in the code base as a Middleware
> in the server, and as function on the client ???

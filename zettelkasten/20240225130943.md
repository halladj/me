# Application Tools Proposal:

The problem is formulated as a *set of agents(mobile phones)* and a *controller (Raspberry Pi)* that communicate over a *local network (LAN)* over sockets.
I propose the use of:

  1. For the controller either ***Go Langauge*** *or* ***TypeScript*** to implement the control loops, and the communication with ***Socket.io***(it supports TCP & UDP).

  2. Mobile application to be written in ***React-Native*** with a ***Socket.io*** client to communicate with the controller.

  3. Agents or mobile **discovery** over the local network (LAN) to initiate the communication with ***mDNS***     or ***SSDP***.

## Reasons:
* Go Langauge has a one-of-a-kind Concurrency model( channels and Go routines) which is very performant and relatively easier to model (Communication with messages exchanged over channels rather than shared memory).

* Socket.io client implementation is available on different platforms and languages. Could make clients for other types of agents, laptops for example.

* *mDNS* or *SSDP* to initiate communication rather than hard-coding it.

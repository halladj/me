# Application Tools Proposal:

The problem is formulated as a *set of agents(mobile phones)* and a *controller (Raspberry Pi)* that communicate over a *local network (LAN)* over sockets.
I propose the use of:

  1. For the controller either ***Go Langauge*** *or* ***TypeScript*** to implement the control loops, and the communication with ***Socket.io***(it supports TCP & UDP).

  2. Mobile application to be written in React-Native with a ***Socket.io*** client to communicate with the controller.

  3. Agents or Mobiles Discovery over the local network (LAN) to initiate the communication with ***mDNS***     or ***SSDP***.

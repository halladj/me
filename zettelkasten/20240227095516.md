# How to downgrade Software:

Arch full system upgrades just break software( sometimes even entire installs ), but solving those issues isgenerally fairly simple you just have to ***Downgrade*** a library or a piece of software so that your system is back up and runing. To do so there are two approaches i follow

1. **Manual Downgrades** from the cache, which is located in `/var/cache/pacman/pkg/*`, and using the following command we can achieve that: `# pacman -U /var/cache/pacman/pkg/<NameOfYourPackage>`.

2. **[downgrade](https://github.com/archlinux-downgrade/downgrade)** is a script available at the AUR to make downgrades easier you just give it the package name and the it will handle the entire thing for you, it can be installed as follows: `paru -S downgrade`, and used as follow: `downgrade foo bar`.

where it would show you the available versions of the packages foo and bar and give you the ability to rollback to any of them.

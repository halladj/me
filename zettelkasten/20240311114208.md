# Real-time communication:

## Polling 

* lowers-level one of them where we would have to make the requests by hand. It just keep senting peroidic polling request each fixed interval, to get any updates ( new messages ). But we must take into concideraton the fact that sending that many request from alot of clients would create a botleneck( problem ). 

    we would know learn how to get around this former problem( bottleneck ).

    1. we could use **requestAnimationFrame** to get around it and use with it **setTimeOut**.

    2. ***Pause and Backoff***, is a popular approach it even a relevent quetion in
         Job Interviews, **Axios** is a good example of a librtary that supports backoff out of the box.
         >> this is what must ne used whenver real time is envolved,
         >> it is similar to the **backoff** we used in 802.11 Mac layer.


## HTTP/2 (push):

* Basically open a connection and get multiple responses for a corresponding single request.
    Some of the additions added with HTTP/2 is **Request Multiplexing**, **Access to Binary Data**, 
    **Request Prioritization**, and **Long running Request**.

    With *HTTP/2* we handle *streams* from the requester(browser)
    using a syntax similar to *Event-Driven Programming* `http.on('request', () => {})`.

    When we get a requet **stream** would fire then afterwards **request** is gonna fire.

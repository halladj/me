# Software architecture stack:


We aim to make a software stack(a Middleware) that would enable us to create services that would be deployed individually on Smart-Agents such that would had a  *homogeneous System*.


The structure would look something like this.

1. at the buttom sets the **Discovery** we do here the context scan & agent identification and fill out our data structures.

2. **Services assurance**. we assume for now that for now (there is no *DDoS* attacks) so all agents are **robust** faible.

3. on top of them we find **Selection** that would pick one Agent and starts the *Collaboration phase*.


## Today's job:

1. Create at least the Go code for the *Discovery phase* & starts with the
    *Collaboration phase* A.K.A healing physical agent side.

2. Add services to the **TXT record** on the *zeroconf* entries.

3. do the same thing on the mobil app now and make cross-platform.

## Progress:

1. now Discovery service reads the context and scans for services( adds them to SCA ).

# How to store git access-token localy:

VS code have became quite the standrd nowdays for development, since it offers aton of quality of life features, or as I like to call it magic. One of those things that we do once and forget about, is hooking up vscode to out github profiles. So whenever we need to push into our remote repositories we don't have to re-authenticate. However isn't there another method to the would achive the same goal but without giving permissions to another microsoft tool.

## Use git's built-in features:

git offer multiple methods to localy keep your credentials so there would be no need to use a third-party tool, or editor to keep us authenticated. Firsly we can just store the access token locally be using this command `git config --global credential.helper store`. The former command make a modification in our global git config, where it made the credential helper to set to store. Which would store the access token after next authentication locally. Another method is to use the [**git-credential-manager**](https://github.com/git-ecosystem/git-credential-manager).

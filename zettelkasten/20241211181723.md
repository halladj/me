# How to use a printer on arch 101:



## Blind steps:
* First step we must lunch the CUPS server, with the command `sudo systemctl start cups.service`.

* If connected using usb, a good way to check connectevity is using the command, `lsusb`

* to show the usb uri, we can run this command: `lpinfo -v`. It must be under root.

* to show the the list of printers drivers available we can run: `lpinfo -v`. It must be under root.

* You can access the CUPS page using this URL, `http://localhost:631/`

* I have an EPSON printer, so but it is not available on CUPS by defult, so I had to install the appropriate driver.
* the package was luckely available on AUR, under the name *epson-inkjet-printer-escpr*.

* after intalling it now I had to test.


## Usage:

### CLI:
* using the `lpadmin`, command as follows.

```
lpadmin -p QUEUE_NAME -E -v "usb://....." -m drv:///HP/hp-deskjet_940c.ppd.gz

```

### GUI:

* I'm using the DEEPIN gui, named dde-printer.


## How to scan:

* since I have an EPSON scanner, i had to install the `iscan` tool.
* I have already installed the drivers in the former steps we can move to the next step.
* To very that everything is in place, we run the command that should list all the connected scanners.
    `scanimage -L`

* finally let's scan. We can use the same tool, `scanimage` directly. Or use some GUI like.`simple-scan`.
`scanimage --format=png --resolution=300 > scan.png`

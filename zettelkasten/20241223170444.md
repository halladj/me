# ASP.NET networking Intro:

 * To create a new webapi, we use the dotnet cmd, as follows: `dotnet new webapi -n APP_NAME`
 * To *enable* swagger, API endpoint visualization, we must add swagger package using NuGet.
    * To do so we use the **dotnet** cli. 
    `dotnet add [PROJECT_NAME].csproj  package Swashbuckle.AspNetCore`

    * We can find the *swagger ui* page at: `http://localhost:5114/swagger/`

* We always return statuc code with our respones. to do so we can do.
    * `Results.Ok(response);`

* if want to match the "/" route, one way to do that is, MapPost(string.Empty, ()=>{});
    * To send a request, => student uses **PostMan**. 
      I => use **HttPie**, `http POST localhost:5114 "att1"="val" "att2"="val"`

* Its perfered to use a *RouteGroup* when working with related routes. 
    * `var employeeRoute =  app.MapGroup("employees")`

## Parameter Binding:

* As a parameter for the *handler* function, we can pass any kind of *delegate*(controller as we call it) you want. But the order of params must be respected.
    1. Params using **Bind**/**From**.
    2. Special Types like **HttpContext**.
    3. Route Params/ Query Strings.
    4. Services from the DI container.
    5. Body of the request.

## Testing:

* ***Never Nest .csproj, so put always the tests in the same directory level as The API and not inside it.***
* When Writing test we must ensure that the *Program* class is accecible so we add this statement.`
using TheEmployeeAPI;`

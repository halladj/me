# Thoughts on DOT.NET:

So this is gonna be some of my ideas and thoughts about DOT.Net platform so far. **.NET** is acually a runtime env + a bunch of tools to build enterprise grade applications.
C# is one of the language used to access .NET, C# compiles down to an *intermediate code* that could run on the platform.

I can not stop myself drawing the parallel between **Java** & **C#**, after all it was invented after Oracle made huge restrictions to be a java replacement.
Before i forget, we can not create test projects inside an ASP.NET we have to create them next to each other. And link them using dotnet config.

ASP.NET is the goto-way to create a web application. It provides a plenty of quality of life features, like *Tests*, and out of the box *Swagger* integration. While
providing a really well documented std library, however I am not a huge fan of its Threads and Concurrency.

I have been having a real pleasure teaching it so far, will update this since I'm done with my ASP.NET course.

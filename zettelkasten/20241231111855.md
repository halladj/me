# C# Deserialization Gotcha:

When using `System.Text.Json` Deserialization method, you might face this error: *`Unhandled exception. System.InvalidOperationException: Each parameter 
in the deserialization constructor on type 'Task' must bind to an object property or field on deserialization`*, which just requires the creation of an 
empty constructor. For example I had a **Task** class that had a constructor with the following signature: Task(int id, string name). And it kept popping. 
Until I looked it up, and all i had to do is create this constructor, **`Task(){}`**.

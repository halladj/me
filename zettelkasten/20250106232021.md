# Keybord layout tuggle on arch-linux

Well when using a tilling windows manager on linux
you lose some if the quality if life tools such as 
the ability of changing keyboard langauge on the fly(or do u?).

Well we can tuggle keymaps easily using *Shift-Alt*, however some setup is requured beforehand.
For a test we can run in privilaged mode: 'loadkeys us mk' for exmaple. And to make them permenent. We have to
set the *KEYMAP_TOGGLE* var to the secondary language in the
'/etc/vconsole.conf' file.

Type assertions in Go are used to extract the underlying value of an interface 
and confirm its concrete type. The syntax is value, ok := interface.(Type), where 
ok is a boolean indicating success. If the type matches, the value is extracted; otherwise,
ok is false. Itâ€™s crucial for working with interfaces safely and avoiding runtime panics.

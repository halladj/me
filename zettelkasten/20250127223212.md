In Go, the idiomatic pattern `var _ InterfaceName = TypeName{}` or `var _ InterfaceName = (*TypeName)(nil)` ensures at compile
time that a type satisfies an interface, making your intent explicit and preventing runtime errors. 
The first form is used when the type is a value, while the second ensures a pointer type satisfies the interface, particularly
if methods have pointer receivers. 
This approach is self-documenting, enforces interface compliance, and provides refactoring safety, making it invaluable for writing 
clear and maintainable Go code.

# Ethernet setup problem:

I have been facing a random mis-config for a while now, where my eth interface gets assigned a static ip address although removed the static config from `/network/interfaces`. After some thinkering I figured out that, the static config was saved under the name *Profile 1*, and wherever I use that interface I get a *Connected to Profile 1*. 

The connection is managed by **NetworkManager**, so I had two options either:
1. modify that connection Profile.
2. Delete the connection profile.


To delete the connection profile we use this command: `nmcli connection delete CONNECTION_NAME`.

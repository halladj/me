# How to connect to wireguard VPN:

This tutorail assumes that you have a unix machine (linux, BSD or mac), and that there is a Wireguard server running.

## Initial Config:
So the first step would installing the Wireguard guard client on your machine, for a debian based distros you can run the following command `sudo apt install wireguard`.

Following that now we need to generate a key-pari, since Wireguard uses asymetric-encryption, that could be generated using the command *wg*.

follow these suite of commands to generate the keys properly:

1. `umask 077`
2. `wg genkey > privatekey # this command will generate a private-key in a file called **privatekey**`
3. `wg pubkey < privatekey > publickey # this command will generate a public-key from the private-key generated earlier`

This files will be created at the following path `/etc/wireguard`.

## Client Configuration:

Now after generating the key-pair, we must create our Wireguard client configuration, first step would be create the configuration file using the following command: `touch /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf`.

Following that, now we have to write into the config file, i will provide a template file that we will edit togeather bellow.
```
[Interface]
PrivateKey = [PRIVATEKEY_GENERATED_EARLIER]
Address = [IP_ADDRESS_TO_BE_ASSIGNED_TO_YOUR_MACHINE]
ListenPort = [PORT_YOU_ARE_USING]

[Peer]
PublicKey = [PUBLICKEY_OF_WIREGUARD_SERVER]
Endpoint = [PUBLIC_@_OF_WIREGUARD_SERVER]
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0
```
Now just fill-in the gaps, by puting in the values corresponding to your machine, and wiregurad server.

## Add Peer on the Wireguard Server:

Inform the system-admin, or just follow the Web-interface.


## Wrap Everything Together:

Now we could connect into our VPN using the following command: `sudo wg-quick up wg0`, we could check that it actually connected using the follwoing command: `sudo wg-quick show`.

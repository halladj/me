# How to convert MarkDown file into a PDF using Pandoc:

1. sudo apt install pandoc texlive
2. simply run `pandoc notes.md -o notes.pdf`

> simply put pandoc requires/depends on texlive to generate the the pdf (it is the engine to use).



## Video script idea:

So the basic idea is, is a series thingy where i will go through everything ive used to take notes for the past couple years, the Zettelcasten system, markdown, and now this way to convert it into code.

1. first video should be a general overview, that will have a latex formula and stuff like that.

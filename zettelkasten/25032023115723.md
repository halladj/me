# Docker Storage ( PART 5 ) Storage Drivers:

## Storage Drivers Vs Docker Volumes:
Docker uses *storage drivers* to store imgae layers, and to store data in the writable layer of
the container. The container *writable layer* **does not** persist after the container is deleted, but is suitable for storing ephemeral data that
is generated at runtime. We can use Storage drivers for optimiazing space efficiency, but the write-speed
is reduced compared to native file-system, ecpecially for storage drivers that use a copy-on-write
filesystem. *Write-intnesive* applications are impacted by a performance overhead, if pre-existing data
exists in the read-only layer.

We use *Docker Vlolumes* for data-intensive applications.

## What is a Docker Storage Driver:
It is handler that takes care of the details about the way the deffirent layers of an image(from the Dockerfile and all), 
Different storage drivers are available, and each have some + and -, and we pick the suitable one based on the need of that 
specific Docker image.

***Side Note***, The only differnce between am image and a contianer is the *container's* writable layer where
each container has it own, and gets deleted when the container gets deleted.
